# Chess-Bot

#Features
•GUI for Gameplay: An interactive chessboard built using pygame for playing chess against the bot or other players.
•AI-powered Moves: The bot leverages the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making(still under development).
•Chess Rules Implementation:
•Castling
•En passant
•Pawn promotion
•Move Validation: Ensures all moves follow chess rules and accounts for checks and checkmates.
•Custom Board States: Ability to load and analyze custom chess board setups.
